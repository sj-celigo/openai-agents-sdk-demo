# OpenAI Agents SDK - Project Ideas for Learning Agentic Workflows

This document contains 5 project ideas of increasing complexity to help understand key concepts of agentic workflows using the OpenAI Agents SDK.

## 1. Personal Research Assistant

**Key Concepts**: Tool use, web search integration, summarization, citation management

**Description**:
- Build an agent that can research a topic across multiple sources
- Implements tools for web search, content extraction, and summarization
- Teaches: function calling, context management, iterative refinement

**Complexity**: Beginner-friendly

**What You'll Learn**:
- How to define and register tools/functions for agents
- Managing conversation context across multiple interactions
- Extracting and synthesizing information from various sources
- Implementing citation and source tracking

## 2. Smart Task Decomposition Agent

**Key Concepts**: Planning, task breakdown, dependency management, multi-step execution

**Description**:
- An agent that takes complex goals and breaks them into actionable subtasks
- Demonstrates how agents can plan, prioritize, and track progress
- Teaches: hierarchical planning, state persistence, goal-oriented behavior

**Complexity**: Intermediate

**What You'll Learn**:
- How agents can plan and decompose complex tasks
- Managing task dependencies and execution order
- Persisting agent state across sessions
- Implementing progress tracking and reporting

## 3. Code Review & Refactoring Assistant

**Key Concepts**: Multi-file analysis, code understanding, suggestion generation

**Description**:
- Agent analyzes codebases, identifies issues, and suggests improvements
- Uses tools to read files, run linters, execute tests
- Teaches: context switching, code reasoning, iterative feedback loops

**Complexity**: Intermediate

**What You'll Learn**:
- Working with file system operations as agent tools
- Analyzing and understanding code structure
- Generating actionable suggestions and improvements
- Implementing iterative refinement workflows

---

## 4. Autonomous Data Pipeline Builder

**Key Concepts**: Tool chaining, error handling, adaptive workflows

**Description**:
- Agent that can fetch data from APIs, transform it, analyze it, and generate reports
- Handles errors gracefully and adapts when data sources fail
- Teaches: robust error handling, dynamic tool selection, data validation

**Complexity**: Intermediate-Advanced

**What You'll Learn**:
- Chaining multiple tools to accomplish complex workflows
- Implementing robust error handling and recovery
- Dynamic tool selection based on context
- Data validation and transformation patterns

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**Key Concepts**: Agent orchestration, role specialization, message passing

**Description**:
- Multiple specialized agents (researcher, writer, critic) collaborate on a task
- Each agent has specific tools and responsibilities
- Teaches: agent coordination, communication protocols, consensus building

**Complexity**: Advanced

**What You'll Learn**:
- Designing and orchestrating multiple agents
- Implementing communication protocols between agents
- Role specialization and division of responsibilities
- Consensus building and decision-making mechanisms

---

## Common Elements Across All Projects

Each project implementation should include:

1. **Clear Architecture**: Well-defined agent roles and responsibilities
2. **Tool/Function Implementations**: Properly structured function definitions
3. **State Management Patterns**: Handling conversation state and persistence
4. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Graceful failure handling
5. **Example Usage**: Demonstrations of agent capabilities
6. **Documentation**: Clear explanations of design decisions

## Getting Started

Choose a project based on your current skill level and learning goals:
- **New to agentic workflows?** Start with Project 1 or 2
- **Familiar with basics?** Try Project 3 or 4
- **Ready for advanced concepts?** Tackle Project 5

Each project builds foundational knowledge that will be useful for more complex agentic systems.

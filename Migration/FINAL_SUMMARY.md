## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Test
```bash
# Verify installation
python cli.py version
# Output: Research Assistant v0.1.0

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
# Output: 55 passed in ~1.2s

# Check coverage
pytest --cov=src
# Output: 90.03% coverage
```

### Usage (Same as Before!)
```bash
# Basic research
python cli.py research "vector databases"

# With options
python cli.py research "AI trends" --depth comprehensive --output results.md

# Interactive mode
python cli.py interactive
```

### Programmatic (Same API!)
```python
from src.agent import ResearchAgent

agent = ResearchAgent()
result = agent.research("quantum computing")
print(result.summary)
```

---

## 💡 New Capabilities (Thanks to SDK)

### 1. Built-in Tracing
```python
# Automatic tracing to external tools
# Supports: Logfire, AgentOps, Braintrust, etc.
```

### 2. Session Support (Easy to Add)
```python
from agents import SQLiteSession

session = SQLiteSession("user_123")
result = Runner.run(agent, query, session=session)
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflows (Future)
```python
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    handoffs=[writing_agent, fact_checker]
)
```
